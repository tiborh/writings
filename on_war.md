On War
======

We thought that wars can be avoided. We believed in the possibility of
eternal peace. Of course we had to disregard the "small wars"  all
around in "less developed" regions, but in the end the war took root
in "our regions" as well. The U.N. had to give up the "no war can be
supported" resolution and work out the "roles of the game".

1. Roles of the Game:
   a. every country is divided up into regions, as homogeneously as
	   possible based on:
	    (i)   nationality
		(ii)  culture
		(iii) geography
		(iv)  historical group identity
	b. the satisfaction of a region with its central government is
		regularly measured by international organisations
		(continuously and representatively)
	c. if a region is dissatisfied (lower acceptance than 30%) with its
		governance in five consecutive years, a neighbouring country
		can challenge the authority of the country over the region
		where it currently belongs.
	d. if the challenged country can:
		(A) hold a referendum (financed 50-50% by the challenger and
			challenged) and if the region wants to belong to the
			challenger (qualified majority of the vote), they can be handed
			over to the challenger peacefully.
		(B) if the challenged country does not want a referendum or
			does not want to recognise the results of one, the
			challenger can take the case to the General Assembly,
			where they can approve their claim to a rightful localised
			war.
	e. a challenger country cannot
		(i)  be in debt
		(ii) buy weapons on loan
	f. a challenged country cannot
		(i)  buy weapons on loan after it has been challenged
		(ii) try to influence the composition of the population after
			 it has become eligible to challenge
2. General mobilisation is not supported.
   a. unless in the defence of internationally recognised borders
	   against an aggressor breaking the Roles of the Game
   b. unless needed to take part in a U.N. sanctioned a punitive war
	   as an attacker
3. U.N. Sanctioned Punitive War:
   a. any country that starts a war outside its own borders can be
	  subject to a punitive war if the U.N. general assembly accepts
	  that resolution with simple majority.
   b. a punitive war is always waged by a coalition of countries.
   c. any country that breaks the "roles of the game" can be subject
	   to punitive war if the general assembly votes for it with
	   qualified majority
4. Minimum Values of Majority:
   * Simple majority:    51%
   * Qualified majority: 67%
   * High majority:      75%
5. Rightful Localised War:
   a. in defence of a country's internationally recognised borders,
	   or
   b. in the bounds of the "roles of the game"
   c. can be fought by professional armies only
   d. the total loss of civillian life cannot exceed 0.1%.
   e. the total loss of civillian property cannot exceed 0.1%.
6. Professional soldiers:
   a. can be recruited only voluntarily
   b. receive their main income for being a soldier
   c. receive regular training and education from the state in the
	   form of accredited trainings and courses
   d. can be sent to war after a minimum 1 year of being a professional
	   soldier
   e. cannot be sent to war unless properly trained
   f. a contracted period cannot take longer than the length of the
	   accredited training and education they receive in the army
   g. must be citizens of the country in whose army they fight
7. accredited trainings and education:
   a. only U.N. accredited and regularly inspected institutions,
	   courses, and training regimes are accepted.

As a result, wars first became more frequent but more
controlled. Unemployment benefits were provided for shorter periods of
time and immigrants were welcomed if they were willing to fight in
armies.
