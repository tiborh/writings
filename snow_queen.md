Snow Queen
----------

(a sketch)

1. Family (Mother/Father/Daughter (other child/children?)) get a free
   holiday on a tropical island.
2. They accept an leave. The mother likes tropical places for holiday
   destinations. The father and daughter would prefer cold
   destinations in the north.
3. A tour guide shows them around on the island. The mother spends most
   of her time on the beach but the father and daughter often leave
   her there with her new friends and go on some trips around the
   island and often there is only three of them with the guide.
4. One day there is a storm, after which the guide becomes strangely
   silent. The daughter starts having dreams of another world, an ice
   and snow covered cold but beautiful one, with exquisite ice
   crystals everywhere. The island turns about 10
   centigrade colder than before, and does not warm up again. The
   mother starts to visit the indoor warmed pools instead of the beach.
5. When they are visiting some ruins, the guide is attacked by a female
   warrior. He manages to fend her off and eventually needs to cut her to
   pieces because she turns out to be a golem, which fights until it
   can, even without a head or arm. Then, he picks up the
   pieces, with the help of some small female golems, places them into
   a basket, with the exception of the head, which one of the small
   golems carry in her hands carefully, the head still actively
   talking to them, but now cheerfully. The guide takes the basket on
   his shoulders and leaves through a portal which opens in a cellar
   doorway.
   A new guide arrives and appraises the situation. She finds a small
   note on a column, with short apology that the first guide needs to
   leave, and thanks for taking over the tour.
6. The couple discovers that their daughter collapsed during the
   commotion. She is getting colder despite the fire they light next
   to her. The new guide has a look at the back of the note, which has
   a symbol on it. She throws the note on the fire to summon the
   former guide. He comes back, they hardly recognise him because he
   started to transform into his form in the other dimension. He
   examines the girl and says that under the guise of the previous
   storm, when the two worlds temporarily became connected, not only
   the golems arrived but also the Snow Queen's summons.
7. The snow queen, the guide explains, would probably like to adopt
   their daughter. They cannot really do too much, if they do not give
   her up, she will turn completely frozen and then the queen appears,
   the temperature is already dropping around them, and most of the
   island will be destroyed if she steps on it.
8. The guide also explains that when the daughter gets reawaken up by the
   queen, she will remember all her past only in a patchy way, she
   won't recognise her parents as parents and won't remember any
   emotions from her past, only memory fragments will remain, just
   like data in an archive.
8. The father agrees to accompany her daughter. The mother rather
   stays behind, she has already had enough of the cooling air.
9. The guide and the father carrying the daughter leave through a
   portal, after which the temperature starts to rise.
10. The trio are joined by the restored warrior golem and the small
   golems and they start their journey north to the realm of the snow
   queen. (some adventures can happen on the way if you are into such
   things))
11. The queen lives on an island in an ice castle, the huge lake around
   the castle is frozen but if anyone attempts to cross uninvited,
   the ice opens up and the freezing water swallows them up.
12. The small group settles down on the lake shore and light a small
   fire, waiting for a sign from the snow queen. The sign is that
   sparks start to fly around from the fire and freeze in mid-air,
   falling to the ground with crystal-like tings.
13. They notice the queen standing on the shore on the island. The
   guide stands facing her, they both raise their arms and a bridge of
   ice forms between them.
14. They all cross the bridge, the queen takes them into the castle,
   revives the girl, who does not recognise her father as her father
   but strangely remembers his name when he reintroduces himself to
   her.
15. The queen says that the girl will become her daughter, acolyte,
   and heiress (after she leaves to the realm beyond). And the
   father, if he can accept that the old emotional bond between them
   is gone, can remain as a co-tutor of the girl, and can teach her
   science (which he is an expert of). He accepts and asks if
   there is a way to send a letter back into his world to explain the
   situation. The queen explains it is not needed as she will send a
   storm into his world after which their memory in other people's
   mind will fade. They will be thought of by anyone they knew as
   distant acquaintances, not forgotten, but as someone they have not
   met or contacted for too long to try to reconnect. If they met
   them, they would know they once knew them but would not know where
   to place them.
