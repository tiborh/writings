Prepositions
============

For learners who learn English as a foreign language, getting the prepositions right may be pretty tough at times. Some of the reasons why:

The very structure of one's mother tongue can be utterly different: take the example of 
[agglutinative languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language) where affixes (prefixes and/or 
suffixes) are used in place of prepositions. Typically, these languages use end-heavy words with often several suffixes glued one after the other at the end. Just imagine how disorienting English seems to be to a speaker who cusomarily 
expresses ideas in one word for which English prefers a prepositional phrase. These learners will be happier to use _heretofore_ than _up to now_ (or _so far_).

This leads to the second problem. First, lots of language learners tend to be uncomfortable with multi-part words and insist on using single words, not noticing that by doing so they sound a bit more formal (or awkward in certain social contexts) than they intend to be. In an intimate conversation _come back soon_ sounds more natural than _return soon_. You will never notice this in a classroom setting in your home country, but once you speak good enough to move about in real native English environment, you will stick out with your Latin vocabulary (like a sore thumb). As a telling illustration, a major area for improvement in the summer school report a student received from a London language school was the lack of idiomatic English in his vocabulary.

Another typical problem for foreign language learners of English that there is a great number of words whose part of speech depends on the context they appear in. This is an especially acute problem with prepositions, most of which can also function as adverbs. What's more, there is a circular definition for this phenomenon: 1. when it is an adverb, you can put it after the object of the verb, 2. it is an adverb when you can put it after the object of the verb. It is just natural for a native English speaker that you can only _put up with a friend_ but you can both _put a friend up_ and _put up a friend_ (but only _put him up_) _for the night_ to sound natural.

English may seem deceptively easy when you start learning it (if you disregard its almost chaotic spelling system), but as time goes by, you can easily get tangled in it like in a thick, dark fairy-tale forest or like a fly in a cobweb.
