Prepositions
============

For learners who learn English as a foreign language, getting the prepositions right may be pretty tough at times.

The very structure of one's mother tongue can be utterly different: take the example of 
[agglutinative languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language) where affixes (prefixes and/or 
suffixes) are used in place of prepositions. Just imagine how disorienting English seems to a speaker who can 
express something in one word for which English needs a prepositional phrase.
