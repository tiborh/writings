Prepositions
============

For learners who learn English as a foreign language, getting the prepositions right may be pretty tough at times.

The very structure of one's mother tongue can be utterly different: take the example of 
[agglutinative languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language) where affixes (prefixes and/or 
suffixes) are used in place of prepositions. Typically, these languages use end-heavy words with often several suffixes glued one after the other at the end. Just imagine how disorienting English seems to a speaker who can 
express something in one word for which English needs a prepositional phrase. These learners will be happier to use _heretofore_ than _up to now_ or _so far_.

This leads to the second problem. First, language learners tend to be uncomfortable with multi-part words and insist on using single part words, not noticing that by doing so they sound a bit more formal than they intend to be. In an intimate conversation _come back soon_ sounds more natural than _return soon_. You will never notice this in classroom setting, but once you speak good enough to have real native English friends, you cannot get away with your Latin vocabulary.

Another typical problem for foreign language learners of English that there is a great number of words whose part of speech depends on the context they appear. This is an especially acute problem with prepositions most of which can also function as adverbs. What's more, there is a circular definition for this: 1. when it is an adverb, you can put it after the object of the verb, 2. it behaves as an adverb when you can put it after the object of the verb. It is just natural for a native English speaker that you can only _put up with a friend_ but you can both _put a friend up_ and _put up a friend_ (but only _put him up_) to sound natural.
