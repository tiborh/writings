The Characters in A Room with a View

Unfortunately, I do not know too many actors and actresses and surely not one of them would really match
any of the roles in the book as I interpret them.

Why?

Simply because I never imagine full people behind the characters. For me, they are mere characters 
in the book with no features where the book does not emphasise them or where they are not absolutely 
necessary from the story's point of view.

How is this? It is easier to understand via an example: Whereas, it is important that Mr Emerson is 
an old gentleman, for his wisdom, for not being a possible suitor to Lucy, for his illness, etc, it 
is not important at all whether Lucy is beautiful or not, or what colour hair or eyes she has.

Based on the above, I will list the characters and what is important in them to meet for an actor or 
actress not to cause (too much) disappointment.

* Charlotte Bartlett: she should look the role of a spinster, who is relatively old compared to Lucy
but she may not be considered even middle-aged to our standards. She acts (or wants to act) as an
over-worrier (even a worrywart) but deep inside she feels the post-Victorian stuffiness of the values
of her social circles highly burdensome. She does not know how to get rid of them, that is how to set
about breaking them down.

* Lucy changes the most: she starts off as a quiet protege of Charlotte but by the end she develops into 
a fully independent, if highly fallible, grown-up woman. Her fallacy which almost makes a copy-cat 
Charlotte from her is that she pretends to be a fully rational being who acts along the lines of some
lofty ideals but in reality needs the protective hands and arms of a George. Based on this, she should
look the role of an innocent dependent girl but at the same time she should also be the obstinate artist
who is prone to moodiness and aloofness.

* Mr Emerson
