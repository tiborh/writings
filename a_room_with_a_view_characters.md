The Characters in A Room with a View
====================================

_Prepared for ColWri.3.11 "A Room with a View" by Forster: BerkeleyX Book Club_

Unfortunately, I do not know too many actors and actresses and surely not one of them would really match
any of the roles in the book as I interpret them.

Why?

Simply because I never imagine full people behind the characters. For me, they are mere characters 
in a story with no features where the book does not emphasise them or where they are not absolutely 
necessary from the story's point of view. They tend to be faceless entities for me, flashed out only
through their words, deeds, and the descriptions given about them.

How is this? It is easier to understand via an example: Whereas, it is important that Mr Emerson is 
an old egalitarian gentleman, to suit his wisdom, his not being a possible suitor to Lucy, for his illness, 
etc; it is not important at all whether Lucy is beautiful or not, or what colour hair or eyes she has.

Based on the above, I will list the characters and what is important in them to meet for an actor or 
actress not to cause (too much) disappointment. (Sometimes the disappointment comes from the players' 
distracting richness of character, which is not there in the book.)

* _Charlotte Bartlett_: she should look the role of a spinster who is relatively old compared to Lucy
but she may not be considered even middle-aged to our standards. She acts (or wants to act) as an
over-worrier (even a worrywart) but deep inside she feels the post-Victorian stuffiness of the values
of her social circles highly burdensome. She does not know how to get rid of them, that is how to set
about breaking them down, or if she want to do that at all.

* _Lucy_ changes the most: she starts off as a quiet protege of Charlotte but by the end she develops into 
a fully independent, if highly fallible, grown-up woman. Her fallacy which almost makes a copy-cat 
Charlotte from her is that she pretends to be a fully rational being who acts along the lines of some
lofty ideals but in reality needs the protective hands and arms of a George. Based on this, she should
look the role of an innocent dependent girl (who can credibly turn into a woman on the screen) but at 
the same time she should also be the obstinate artist who is prone to moodiness and aloofness.

* _Mr Emerson_ starts off as the most irritating and puzzling character in the book: he always wants to
help but his good will is constantly misunderstood because he cannot communicate in the formalities of his
era. By the end, he turns out to be the sage who has learnt from the mistakes and tragedies of his life 
and can help others, here namely Lucy, to avoid major pitfalls in their lives. Judging from this role, 
this old gentleman should look innocuous yet each of his move is socially awkward.

* At the beginning of the story, _George Emerson_ lives in the shadow of his father the same way as Lucy 
in that of an overpowering Charlotte. Later, he both finds his voice and courage (kissing Lucy even for 
the second time), but also becomes timid, accepting Lucy's dismissal and willing to retreat to London 
immediately. The asymmetry between Lucy and George is the asymmetry between Charlotte and Mr Emerson. It 
is very little that Charlotte can help but it is a great deal that Mr Emerson can help, funnily not directly 
his son but Lucy.

* The reverends _Mr Beebe_ and _Mr Eager_: What a contrast! The former looks and acts like a real priest,
willing to help the lost sheep of his flock and by being understanding and helpful even if he often does not
have the slightest clue of what is going around him; whereas the latter being an absolute snob, fawning on 
the rich in Rome and excluding everyone from his circles but a fortunate few, making sure they really feel 
or express to be impressed by the privileges the company of English residents in Italy can provide to them. 
So his favours of introducing some select to the jet club in Rome seem to be a really noble gesture in his 
eyes and wants others to see it that way too.

* _Eleanor Lavish_ is the wannabe artist who hopes to become one by learning to imitate the behaviour of an 
eccentric romantic poet. She cannot help it when she comes through as a half-success at most.

* _Cecil Vyse_ is the other poser, besides Eleanor. Perhaps, he does not aspire for the air of an artist, but
of the cultured Victorian. His affectation and pretentions of knowledge and high culturedness are tiresome.
He notices no one but himself and perhaps wants everyone to conform to something he himself cannot meet.

* _Freddy Honeychurch_ is one of the flattest characters in the story. He could be played by any young actor 
who can be pictured as Lucy's brother. He is playful but studious, and does not yet show how he is going to
have an independent adult personality.
