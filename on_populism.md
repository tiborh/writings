On Populism
===========

The Players
-----------

### The Populist
They may confess to a belief or value system but it is more like a role they play than a heart-felt value system. 
If they act consistently, it is because they know that that is the most effective way to win over or hold on to supporters.

### Useful Fools
Usually, they are the people who really live by the values the populist only imitate. 
If they seem rigid, it is because the value system is rigid.
If the value system is more flexible, they may not seem that different from the populist.
The difference is that the populist can act according to multiple value systems and switch between them based on the context and their interests.

### The Observer
They are not fully in for the dominant value system of the land. 
They may adopt this or that part, but can neither play with it as adroitly as the populist nor can they fully become its "full believers" as the Useful Fools do.
The Observer can either be an opportunist, in which they are closer to the Populist, or the believer of another value system.
They may take part in this or that scene of the dominant play in town but most of the time they are satisfied by just observing the going on.
