_written for: BerkeleyX: ColWri2.1x How to Write an Essay on edx.org_

Only one thing seems to be certain: thousands of people have been entering Europe daily for many months now.
Beyond that, nothing seems to be certain. Various explanations exist. The debates range 

* from how to name them: 
  + migrants,
  + immigrants,
  + refugees,
  + a security threat, or
  + potential agents of terrorist organisations,
* to how to behave towards them: to 
  + provide for their immediate needs (food, cleaning facilities, medical aid, temporary shelter),
  + give them permanent shelter,
  + help them integrate if they want to,
  + let the government and the EU handle it (through bureaucracy, police, army),
  + let charitable organisations handle it (with us indirectly contributing), 
  + be indifferent towards them (pretend they do not exist), 
  + send them back where they came from, 
  + not let them enter Europe at all.

This is not the first attempt at this essay. The previous ones all fell apart when more and more elements of the complexity soup have burdened them down and it turned out that to address all the issues, the writing would have to be much longer than I can expect a peer reviewer to spend their dear time on, so I had better abort that approach. All-inclusiveness had to be excluded. So I had to decide what aspect should be the thread that can lead to the heart of the problem.

The best clue arrived when I remembered the several debates we had around the round table in the lunch room and on Facebook. The for and against always reminded me of the Hobbit[1] world: can we preserve the calm and piece of The Shire? Can we shut out the turmoil of the outside world? Do we want to attempt that?

The first major issue is whether we accept the change or reject it. If we do whatever we can to preserve present conditions (the "keep them away" or "pretend they are not here" alternatives), we do nothing else but turning away from the problem. It rarely works. The "keep them away" alternative will only lead to the destabilisation of the areas where the displaced people end up. They will also be more inclined to accept radical ideas if they feel left alone and frustrated in their hopes. Fears and uncertainties open the mind towards those who offer empowerment, that is, fundamentalism and radicalism. The most probable result would be fortress Europe, surrounded by lands of chaos. What would we do with our conscience then? Would it not bother us if we both refused help, destroyed other contries, and would we not live in fear of a possible revenge?

The second most important question is how we can live with the consequences of our decisions. Above, I have already shown a possible consequence of isolationism. But what happens if we let in large numbers of people from different cultures? Can we defuse the clicking time bomb of almost inevitable disappointment?[2] Immigrants tend to have high hopes when they arrive in the rich West and North but eventually, most of them end up in ghetto-like environments isolated from the majority[3]. Do we feel the strength of accepting these people not only into our countries but also into our lives? Can we give a human and helping hand in a way that they can find it easy to accept?

The third problem therefore is the impact on native inhabitants of the host country. It is like Newton's Third Law[4] in a social context. A large number of immigrants appearing too quickly can easily awake fears in citizens[5] and the radical right-wing parties and organisations can strengthen[6] as an impact. Fears from "otherness" may exacerbate the situation. They may fear that they themselves also have to change their way of life[7]. How can you expect accommodation if you do not want to adapt even in the smallest matters? Can we sort out what is central to our culture and what are the things that can go as a proof of good will? 

To sum up, it seems we are treading on dangerous fields.
