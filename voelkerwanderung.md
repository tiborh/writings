Only one thing seems to be certain: thousands of people have been entering Europe daily for many months now.
Beyond that, nothing seems to be certain. Various explanations exist. The debates range 
* from how to name them: 
  + migrants,
  + immigrants,
  + refugees,
  + a security threat, or 
  + potential agents or terrorists
* to how to behave towards them: to 
  + provide for their immediate needs (food, cleaning facilities, medical aid)
  + give them shelter, 
  + let the governments handle it,
  + let charitable organisation handle it, 
  + be indifferent towards them, 
  + send them back where they came from, 
  + not let them enter Europe at all.

So the question is extremely complex.
