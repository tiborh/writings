_written for: BerkeleyX: ColWri2.1x How to Write an Essay on edx.org_

Only one thing seems to be certain: thousands of people have been entering Europe daily for many months now.
Beyond that, nothing seems to be certain. Various explanations exist. The debates range 

* from how to name them: 
  + migrants,
  + immigrants,
  + refugees,
  + a security threat, or 
  + potential agents or terrorists
* to how to behave towards them: to 
  + provide for their immediate needs (food, cleaning facilities, medical aid),
  + give them shelter, 
  + let the governments handle it (through bureaucracy, police, army),
  + let charitable organisations handle it (with us indirectly contributing), 
  + be indifferent towards them, 
  + send them back where they came from, 
  + not let them enter Europe at all.

This is not the first attempt at this essay. The previous ones all fell apart when more and more elements of the complexity soup have burdened them down and it turned out that to address all the issues, the writing would have to be much longer than I can expect a peer reviewer to spend their dear time on, so I had better abort that approach. All-inclusiveness had to be excluded. So I had to decide what aspect should be the thread that can lead to the heart of the problem.

The best clue arrived when I remembered the several debates we had around the round table in the lunch room and on Facebook. The for and against always reminded me of the Hobbit[1] world: can we preserve the calm and piece of The Shire? Can we shut out the turmoil of the outside world? Do we want to attempt that?
