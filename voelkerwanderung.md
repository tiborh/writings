Only one thing seems to be certain: thousands of people have been entering Europe daily for many months now.
Beyond that, nothing seems to be certain. Various explanations exist. The debates range 

* from how to name them: 
  + migrants,
  + immigrants,
  + refugees,
  + a security threat, or 
  + potential agents or terrorists
* to how to behave towards them: to 
  + provide for their immediate needs (food, cleaning facilities, medical aid)
  + give them shelter, 
  + let the governments handle it (through bureaucracy, police, army),
  + let charitable organisations handle it, 
  + be indifferent towards them, 
  + send them back where they came from, 
  + not let them enter Europe at all.

This is not the first attempt at this essay. The previous ones have all fallen apart when more and more elements of the complexity soup burdened them down. So I had to decide what aspect to pick out as the topic of this writing. The best clue arrived when I remembered the several debates we had around the round table in the lunch room and on Facebook. The for and against always reminded me of the Hobbit world: can we preserve the calm and piece of The Shire[1] or not? Can we shut out the turmoil of the outside world? Do we want to attempt that?
