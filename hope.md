When you believe that the future of humanity is hopeless, keep silent.

Hope that you are mistaken.

You can always trust the limitations of your knowledge and experience.

Hope that the destructive powers will destroy you sooner than they can discover
 how you can enhance their destructive potential and scope. 
 (Better be regarded useless than useful to help bring destruction.)

Hope that someone can discover how you can help to bring good rather than bad.
