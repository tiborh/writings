Marathon
========

"Marathon?"

"No, thank you. I do not want to die."

Sounds strange? Yes. But also logical. Pheidippides gave his life to carry the message back to Athens. (See the [Wikipedia article][1] as a reference.) We may remember Marathon without this ultimate sacrifice but we would never associate it with running. We would definitely not remember his name. So, to run the perfect marathon, you need to end up dead at the end. If you make a compromise, it is not the real thing.
