Marathon
========

"Marathon?"

"No, thank you. I don't wanna die."

Sounds strange? Yes. But also logical. Pheidippides gave his life to carry the message back to Athens. (See the [Wikipedia article][1] for reference. I did the same.) We would probably still remember Marathon without that ultimate sacrifice but we would never associate it with running. And we would definitely not remember his name. So, to run the perfect marathon, you need to end up dead, full stop. (Don't waste your money on isotonic drinks. It takes the spice out of the soup.) If you make a compromise, it is not the real thing. But is that really the case?

All the sports are like that. They fake something in order to save human life or to dramatically reduce fatalities. How much better is a game on a football pitch than a pitched battle between armed warriors? More casualties among the ultras than on the field.

Another aspect is the distance. There is no way a seasoned runner, like Pheidippides, would die of a mere marathon. But previously he did a 150-miler. After that, the shorter one can be a killer. (may need some expansion in the future)

So, no need to die. What a lucky thing. We have saved a few lives again.
