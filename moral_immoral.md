Can a Book be Moral or Immoral?
===============================

It has always been a hard question if a piece of art can be moral or immoral. A lot seems to depend on 
the context. Let's go through a thought experiment: what if Hitler, after writing _Mein Kampf_, realised:
"How stupid this piece of sh*t is!" "How muddled my ideas have been!"? And what if he started to
change both his thinking and his way of life thanks to writing something out, and reading his own work? Would
that make the book, which most people now consider immoral, a moral book? But let us go on with
the experiment: let's suppose that after his realisation, Hitler sinks his book into a soon to be 
forgotten drawer and pushes it out of his everyday memory. So far, no harm, only benefit. However,
after a time someone finds the book, reads it, gets confirmed in his beliefs and starts a
party to persecute and annihilate a minority. Does a passive book suddenly turn immoral?
