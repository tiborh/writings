# On Thinking #

1. There are those who think in there heads. They do not need anything else but silence and peace to work out everything. When they are finished, they are ready for action.
2. There are those who think with their hands. They need to act it out or experiment in order to get their thoughts together and come up with ideas. Doing and deeper understanding go hand in hand for them.
3. There are those who think with their mouths. They are not independent thinkers: they need others to do a part of the thinking for them. They may be good organisers or managers, though, but an utter nuissance to the first two.
4. There are those who cannot think. Most of them are, however, good at imitating the other three in appearance or action. When they are silent, they get bored. When they act, they either do the routines or go through the motions. When they talk, they do not say too much. They may trick the third for a while, but not so much the first two.
