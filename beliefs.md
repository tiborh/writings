# Beliefs

* Everything in the human mind is a belief, a mental construct we attribute a certain level of probability to.
  * 100% probability means that we accept it as truth and not a belief
* Even the proposition that 'everything is a belief' is a belief. (you cannot delve deeper than this recursive thought)
* Even the belief that nothing is worth believing in is a mere belief.
* Wisdom means that you have a well-selected, more or less congruent system of beliefs which are deeply embedded in your daily 
  routines, personal habits, activities and human relationships.
  * the ability to believe in contradictory and incongruent ideas can save your brain from getting into infinite loops
  * somewhere deep down your brain knows that they are mere models or theories of how you try to find meaning, that is,
    to mentally construct or reflect the outside world. (mental representation)
* Some beliefs you accept not because you are convinced that they are true but because you would like to belong to a group of
  human beings: they are membership requirements of a specific community
  * accepting a belief on this basis may turn them into your "heartfelt believes". After a while they take root because it is 
    much easier to format your brain to adapt to them then to translate between your and the community belief systems
    all the time. (the usage and maintenance of such an interpreter eats up too much energy you can spend on more useful things,
    also, such an interpreter can prevent you from looking spontaneous, native inhabitant of your chosen sphere)

## The Creative Belief

* In the beginning there is belief.
* Then you start acting as if the belief was true.
* The very act of acting on the basis of the verity of the belief can make a part or the whole of the belief come true
  * Your belief can change as you go ahead
  * You may end up with a belief significantly (or utterly) different from the one you started out with
    (the trick is that you should not be aware of these changes so that the belief can remain effective)
  * Your actions, experiences, and beliefs form a feedback circle and therefore have impact on each other.
* A blind, unquestioning belief gives you more power to work for its "materialisation" than being more 'realistic'
  and 'doubtful'.
* Those people who divide beliefs between God- or Nature-given truths and beliefs, will take you as a heretic, cynic or 
  nihilist if you are incapable of making such a distinction. (If you cannot draw the line.)
