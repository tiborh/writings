Elements of Gothic Fiction in Charlotte BrontÃ«'s Jane Eyre
==========================================================

*Written for _BerkeleyX: ColWri3.10x "Jane Eyre" by Bronte: BerkeleyX Book Club_ on Edx.org, week 2*

Although great fiction cannot remain among the bounds of a genre, it grows out from it and the elements of that genre can be pointed out in it, even if the work in question may divert from them at one point. This novel is great in Romantic fiction too: it grows out from Gothic fiction and shows its elements, but is not one hundred percent Gothic. For this reason, it is relatively easy to point out how the author in Jane Eyre uses these elements as starting points but also how she departs from them to encode her own era and message into the novel.

The comparisons in the following sections will be made with Wikipedia's [Elements of Gothic fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction#Elements_of_Gothic_fiction).

Setting: The Mansion
--------------------

It is true that Thornfield Hall is past its heyday in that respect that its current owner is not a permanent resident there, the workforce is greatly reduced, most of the rooms and a complete floor is unused except for the storage of old furnature, but at the same time it is not a crumbling neglected building. It is not difficult for Jane to feel at home there. Of course that cosiness is mainly connected to people (Mr Rochester, Adele, and Mrs Fairfax), but looking at the building when returning "home" after a month's stay in Gateshead she does not have any unpleasant feelings about the building or the garden, which is not a terrifying place as it is a characteristic of Gothic fiction. Of course, it is also true that later the building gets burned down and it is because of the Gothic theme that the reader half-expects something like that. The Gothic decadence is shown not as much by the building as by the owner and in the madness of the hidden person.

The Virginal Maiden
-------------------

Jane fills this role with her inexperience: she has not seen too much of the world, and her human interactions are limited to two theatres of her previous life: Mrs Reeds' home, and Lowood school. She is not a great traveller either. She also fills the role by being young, pure, kind, virtuous, and sensitive. The Gothic mysterious past is transformed into the early death of her parents and because of that she knows hardly anything about her relatives on her mother's side. The modernised version of the Gothic "daughter of an aristocratic or noble family" is turned into "a daughter of a rich merchant" to fit the changed world in Britain. However, one thing is seriously missing: she is not a beauty. Or rather, her beauty is in her soul and not in her appearance. The association between beautiful and good is broken. But not only by Jane but also by Georgiana Reed and Blanche Ingram, who are both beautiful but not good. The only character who is good and beautiful is Bessie Lee, but she does not come through as the embodiment of the Virginal Maiden ideal either.

Older, Foolish Woman
--------------------

Grace Poole seems a perfect match for this role. Her foolishness is in her drinking problems, which later causes the disaster too. Otherwise she is not a fool. She must be overstressed and fatigued by her charge. It should not be only one person to be responsible for the keep of the hidden person.

Clergy
------

The clergy in Gothic fiction is not the friend but the foe. Mr Brocklehurst fits the bill: he is narrow-minded and full of his self-righteousness. Not evil, but a bad character. His weakness is also obvious: almost no one takes him seriously in his school.

Hero and Tyrant/Villain
-----------------------

The Hero and the Tyrannical Villain is in one person. This is a great achievement and insight: your greatest enemy is yourself. The real hero is the villain who can cast away his past and can atone for his past. Mr Rochester often refers to his problematic past and can be a real tyrant for sure. But he wants to break with all that. The burdens of his past live with him: Bertha and Adele. The former a real threat and the cause of his ruin, the second as a constant reminder of his jilted love. By the end, the hero is saved by the Virginal Maiden, which is a harginger of a new era. An era where women can also have more active roles and become heros.
