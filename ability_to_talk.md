The Ability to Talk
===================

A co-worker was talking about her grandma: "Sometimes she complains that she is so much alone that she's forgetting how to talk."

What could she mean? Plain complaint? Not necessarily.

Do people stop talking when they are alone? Not necessarily. Most of us start talking, after a while, to ourselves when alone. We keep practising the ability. I used to know people who were positively talking to the television and radio programs, sometimes debating some points, or adding to the arguments, and so on.
