The Ability to Talk
===================

A co-worker was talking about her grandma: "Sometimes she complains that she is so much alone that she's forgetting how to talk."

What could she mean? Plain complaint? Not necessarily.

Do people stop talking when they are alone? Not necessarily. Most of us start talking to ourselves, after being left alone for a while. We keep practising the skill. I used to know people who were positively talking to the television and radio programs, sometimes debating some points, or adding to the arguments, or giving examples from their own experience.

The problem might be more in listening and taking cues and turns. If you talk to yourself and to the non-responding world (tv, papers, cats and dogs) too much, you may simply get out of practice when it comes to true human interactions. You may not pay enough attention to what the other one says because you are so much imbued with your own narrative, where others play less and less active roles. You may also be at a loss about how to take your turn politely in a conversation. As we normally do it quite unconsciously, once you get out of the habbit, others will not, and cannot, help you but will only express their irritation for your lack of social skills, or you do the same because you tend to experience that they will not let you have your say.

Not a simple matter.
