Language Binds and Divides

Language both binds and divides. This double effect is the easiest to spot between speakers of different nations. Take the example of international companies. It gives a degree of comfort that speaking English helps you understand people from offices in various countries: India, Sweden, the U.S. etc. And there is no problem while it is written English. That is, e-mails. Text chatting is a different matter with all the common abbreviations being a little different in selection and frequency from country to country. You start thinking, for example, what BBS can be and when you realise that your chat partner's status turns yellow, you have an inkling.

When it comes to speaking, you need some time to get used to language variations. First, for example you may not be able to make out the difference between two Indian colleagues speaking to each other in Hindi interspersed with English words, phrases, and sentences; and when they are speaking in English to you. I could also mention an instructor whose British English accent was so refreshing in the sea of foreign language English. Then, in a private conversation when he started to relax his queen's English, there was a point where both of us were surprised how incomprehensible Yorkshire accent can be to the uninitiated.

Each profession has its own jargon. Some fields make it even more difficult by using a massive amount of abbreviations. Inside a company, you can have different sets of abbreviations to learn from project to project. Or, what may sometimes be a source of frustration, new meanings to some of the abbreviations you have confidently used so far. By the time they regard you as a real project member, you speak in three- and four-letter codes incomprehensible outside your department. But it can go even further. I can remember two engineers working on different subsystems of the same product, one not being able to explain a problem to the other because the two teams had such a different vocabulary for the same functionality.
