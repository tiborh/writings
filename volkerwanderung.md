VÃ¶lkerwanderung
===============

Why am I using a historical name? There are at least two reasons. First, there is no agreement over what this phenomenon really is. Is it a refugee crisis? Is it a migration period? It all depends on the main motivation. If they are running for their lives, they are refugees. If they are coming to have a share in the luxuries of Western lifestyle, then they are migrants. But what if they have mixed reasons? What if there is not much difference between the strife to save your biological life and to have a life worth living?

One thing seems to be sure: lots of people have arrived and are going to come into Europe.

Why are They Coming?
--------------------

When their is a war in a neighbouring country, especially when it is not too far from the border, it is not difficult to see why refugees appear in one's country. It is easy to empathise with them and to feal the moral obligation to help. However, when people have started off from a refugee camp and travelled through several peaceful countries, one may pose the question: how come they are so picky?

How Long are They Going to Stay?
--------------------------------

The first and most obvious question: are they going to return to their homeland once the peace has been restored there? Does the decision depend on how soon that time comes? 

How can We Live Together?
-------------------------

If they decide to stay, how much integration can you expect from them? Is integration merely a legal issue or does it have anything to do with culture and customs?

Summmary
--------

A hard nut to crack.
