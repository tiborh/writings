Why the use of a historical name? There are at least two reasons. First, there is no agreement over what this phenomenon really is. Is it a refugee crisis? Is it a migration period? It all depends on the main motivation. If they are running for their lives, they are refugees. If they are coming to have a share in the luxuries of Western lifestyle, then they are migrants. But what if they have mixed reasons? What if there is not much difference between the strife to save your biological life and to have a life worth living?

One thing seems to be sure: lots of people have arrived and are going to come into Europe.

Why are They Coming?
--------------------

When their is a war in a neighbouring country, especially when it is not too far from the border, it is not difficult to see why refugees appear in one's country. It is easy to empathise with them and to feal the moral obligation to help. However, when people have started off from a refugee camp and travelled through several peaceful countries, one may pose the question: how come they are so picky?

Is it because they need a lot of money fast to help them get the full family over as soon as possible?

***What Was the Triggering Factor?***

* The UN cut the daily support quota in the refugee camps in neighbouring countries. (reference is needed)
* International organisations started to distribute information materials how they can take advantage of the European welfare and legal system. (reference is needed)
* Loss of hope the bad times will ever end in their country. (reference is needed)

Do we know anything of the national composition of the immigrants?

How Long are They Going to Stay?
--------------------------------

The first and most obvious question: are they going to return to their homeland once the peace has been restored there? Does the decision depend on how soon that time comes? Does it depend on whether they can feel home here? Does it depend on whether the extended family has been brought over?

How can We Live Together?
-------------------------

If they decide to stay, how much integration can you expect from them? Is integration merely a legal issue or does it have anything to do with culture and customs?

Once they become citizens in the land, can they bring their culture and legal system? How can a country operate where theie are parallel legal and value systems? What about conflicting laws and values? (Social philosophy.)

Or does it all depend on how much weight in numbers they are going to represent?

***What Is the Capacity of the Continent***

There are two obvious extremes: zero and all. We should be able to give a good estimate of how many people can we accept but the question is for how long? How much effort and resource should be allocated? Do we feel up to the task? How much support can a government have from voters? How long will be the patience of the populace?

How can governments face their minorities (e.g. the Roma population) if they spend more on and pay more attention to the newcomers?

***What Say does the Native Population of Europe Have?***

Which will be the stronger? Moral obligation or fear of losing something precious?

The far right is rising as a result of the sudden influx of foreign people. (supporting data are needed) The fears of the inhabitants fuel their ascent. It would be much better to have the questions discussed publicly and let the people have their say in policies.

***Dichotomies***

+ Greed vs generocity (sharing the advantages)
+ Helpfulness vs fear

Summary
--------

A hard nut to crack.
