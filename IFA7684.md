Deluded?
--------

There was once a craftsman, who was good in his trade and people liked his products but one day the thought entered his mind: "what if I tried myself in something else?" Some new trade. A different place. Starting something new. Just then, a stranger appeared in front of his shop with a magnificent horse. The traffic stopped in the street everyone stared at the exceptional steed. The stranger entered the craftsman's' shop and offered him a deal: if you want to become a horse dealer, you can establish your fame and fortune with this magnificent beast, don't you think? The craftsman was mesmerised by the horse. The stranger offered a swap: he will take over his house and shop, and the craftsman can go and try his luck. If he cannot sell the horse in a month for a better money than his property was worth, they can annul the agreement and he gets everything back. The offer was too good to turn down. So he accepted it, took the horse, and went on his way.

At the local market they could not offer enough for the horse, so he went to the nearby town which was famous for its horse market. When he arrived, everyone marvelled at the beauty of the horse. Even the local vet wanted to examine it to make sure it is not deliberate deception or witchcraft. There were several bids for the horse, and the price went up and up. When everyone thought that the winning bid had been paced, suddenly a carriage appeared and the king himself stepped out. He tripled the bid, and when no one else could offer more, he said to the newbie horse dealer: bring the horse to my palace. Be there by the evening. I will pay for the horse and invite you for dinner and you can also spend the night in one of the guest rooms.

After our man had spent some time in the town, to have a little rest, food, and drink, and then he set out for the royal city. It was a hot day. Both he and the horse got thirsty by the time they reached the edge of the city. There was a water pump by the road. He stopped, got off the horse, and started to draw some water for the horse. When the horse attempted to catch a drop of water with its tongue at the mouth of the pump, the animal suddenly vanished as if sucked into the pump. The man rubbed his eyes, not wanting to believe them. Then he looked around to see if someone witnessed the disappearance of the most valuable animal of the kingdom. But no one seemed to have noticed it.

When he looked back, the horse's head seemed to appear in the mouth of the pump. Our man started to yell and ran to the pump trying to rescue the unfortunate animal, but by the time he got there, the horse disappeared again. Other people heard him shout and came up to the pump. The man excitedly told them what had happened but his words were so confused and frantic that everyone believed him to be a madman. Then they noticed that the pump stopped working. They accused the man of breaking it and of inventing a nonsensical story to cover up his misdeed. They started to beat him up. The poor man saw the horse head reappear from the pump again behind the angry people and grin at him maliciously, and then, with a puff of smoke it disappeared. When the people smelled the sulphurous fumes coming from the pump, they started to accuse him of poisoning the well and fell at him beating and kicking him hard.

Hearing the commotion, the city guards appeared and took the man in front of the local magistrate. The magistrate heard him and his accusers out and sent a messenger to the palace to check his story. The messenger came back and confirmed that his majesty was expecting a horse trader in the evening. If he did not arrive by the morning they were to send the mad troublemaker to the palace for interrogation. So our former craftsman and short time horse trader spent the night in a prison cell with a little dry bread and stale water for dinner. Then next day, he was further questioned in the palace and was accused of breaching his contract with the king. They threw him into the dungeon for a year.

By the time he got home, his shop had been sold and no one wanted to recognise the penniless beggar he turned into. As he was sitting on the edge of the town square begging for a little food and a shelter for the night, a stranger passed by and tossed a shiny coin into the dirt in front of him. Before he disappeared, he muttered something like: "I saved this for you from the price of your shop". The poor man picked up the unfamiliar golden coin to examine. One side had some writing in foreign letters, and the other a horse head with a wide grin, looking at him.
