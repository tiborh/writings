# A Doll's Tale #

（人形の物語）

Let's assume there is a world where inanimate objects can turn animate through their frequent interactions with people.


## 一 ##

There was once an old woman. This is a fairy tale so she is not an 'elderly lady' or 'senior female citizen', and we do not want to be cruel either so nor an 'old crone' either. She lived alone with her two grown-up daughters dwelling and making a living in far away countries. This was a time before the internet, and telephone services were expensive, and for those who did not have the best of hearing, the flat voice in the receiver could cause some difficulties in understanding the distant voice on the other end. Most of the time she pretended to understand everything clearly not to make unnecessary fuss, and of course it was impolite to task her with comprehension check questions. She only asked for repetition where crucial numerical details were to be remembered, which is normal in an average conversation, too.

One Christmas, apart from the usual kitchen gadgets and utensils, clothes, and foodstuff, she also received a doll: a big dress-up doll with beautiful glass eyes, removable wig, and replaceable eye-lashes, and two extra sets of clothing. 'A reminder of a second childhood?' she wondered in herself when she first saw it. Then, after a while, when they were among themselves, the two of them, she started to talk to the doll. Later, she even begin to take her to the various rooms she intended to spend some time in. Finally she also started to dress the doll for the various occasions. The doll turned from 'it' into 'she'. But she did not want to give her a name. No. As long as there is only one, she will always know who the other 'she' than herself is.

After a while, the doll appeared in her dreams, too. There, they could talk to each other. The doll turned out to be philosophical and poetic. A pragmatist as a philosopher, and a metrephile in poetry. So, the old lady stopped worrying when one of her daughters skipped a weekly call, or two.

In the end, the she died (would you like her 'to pass away'? you can read it that way too if you are that sensitive) and her possessions got sold, except for the doll, who was sitting on the coffin during the wake.

A little girl and her mother also paid their respects. And she liked the doll very much. She could not take her eyes of her. So, her mother received custody over the doll till her daughter grew up enough to be able to take proper care of it.

It was when she started to go to school. She was a serious and conscientious little girl, so she could be trusted with its care. And as most precocious children, she could also be trusted to be bullied at school.

The doll, therefore, continued to have someone who talked to her while she was awake and who she could converse with in the world of dreams. And she could even expand her soporal acquaintances. Returning nightmares can scare away most bullies. As a result, the little girl was mostly left alone and sometimes even revered as a mysterious witch, whose golem can take revenge.

However, one day, there appeared an obstinate bully transferred from another school, who, even after sleepless nights spent turning round and round on a rubber bed sheet, next to a bedside lamp left switched on, and with dark circles around her eyes during the day, which she could hardly keep open, except for the fear of her scary tormentor. Yet, she simply could not give up taking it all out on someone weaker. In the end, she nodded off in the worst possible moment in her final exhaustion and ended up bruised, broken, and dead.

The doll has acquired a new skill.

The little girl grew up to become a child psychologist. The doll was her assistant. Most little patients liked to have her in their laps: she helped them talk and feel cosy and relaxed. For these children, the doll became a dream fairy, who helped them have a soul-healing dream. A new skill, again.

But the doll could not prevent her owner from dying in her sleep, quite unexpectedly, in an undiagnosed weakness of the heart. Can dolls feel sad?

After the death of her second owner, the doll decided to go into the world and try her luck. She left the city and started to wander around in our imaginary world.

One evening, she entered a town. The streets were deserted. It seemed the people locked up and went to bed quite early. Luckily, she found an inn open and she could take out a room for the night. Everyone seemed sad, slow-moving, and melancholy. 

The next day, only the sun was bright. The town was draped and the people were dressed in black and they, the people, mind you, seemed to be mourning some great loss. But the doll knew the reason, which appeared in her dream: a big toad at the bottom of the well in the centre of the town. This toad spread darkness in the heart of the people through the water in the well. The doll waited till the evening, when the square became deserted and lowered herself into the depth of the well. She greeted the toad and asked him if he would like her to kiss him.

'Yes,' replied the toad with a wide and wild smile, 'that would be great'.

He turned into a king with menacing eyes and a hideous smile.

'Would you like to be my queen?' he asked. 'I can make you rich and comfortable.'

'No, thank you, your majesty' said the doll, trying to be polite and inoffensive, 'I haven't seen enough to settle down, yet.'

The king pretended heartfelt understanding, and felt relieved. He only wanted to look courteous and grateful, as a king supposed to be. And no one saw or heard her refusal, so his pride remained intact.

They helped each other out of the well, wished each other good luck, and she went on her way. And he became the king of the town. He was a cruel king. His first command was that everyone must be happy. And whoever looked sad in his presence, was to be executed.

After some months of further wanderings and wonderings the doll got into a larger town than the previous one. This one did not get deserted in the evenings. She even noticed little ragamuffins hiding in the narrow, dark alleyways. She decided to set up a shelter for them. She collected some of them around herself, as a start, and outside the town they found an abandoned barn which they waterproofed and windproofed enough to be serviceable. The children at last could have peaceful dreams at nights. When the townspeople saw how well she takes care of the children, they offered every kind of help to keep them fed and clothed, and out of the streets. And when the mayor attempted to sue them off the land, they even collected the money and bought the property.

The mayor had his reasons to hate her. He operated an orphanage where he worked the children to the bone and gave them merely enough to eat to be able to stay alive and work. They began to flee into the doll's care. After the doll had had enough of his further machinations, the people of the town started to have dreams of the mayor embezzling their taxes and donations to the orphanage, which turned out to be true when they started to investigate. So, the mayor was dismissed and banished from the town and the doll became the headmistress of the orphanage, which helped the
'barnhouse children' to move into a brick and mortar building, and the barn was turned back into a barn and a workshop, where the children, growing up, could learn useful skills with the help of the farmers and craftsmen of the town,
later becoming apprentices, and eventually masters of their trades.

It was in her headmistress days that a young man started to court the doll. They walked the streets together in the evenings, he helped out in the barn-school, and they sometimes accompanied each other to balls and fairs. One day, he asked her:  'Do you love me?'

'If you have doubts,' the doll said, 'do not ask, lest what you hear may make you sad.'

That was enough to break the magic, and he left the town with a hanging head.

When the eldest ones of her care grew up and matured enough to take over from her, the doll resigned from her post in the orphanage and left the town herself.

After about a further year or so of roving the roads of the country, she reached the edge of a forest, and decided to continue among the trees. In the heart of the thick, she came across a dilapidated shrine. No statue, the name worn off, illegible. It took her some time but she restored the abode and reclaimed a little courtyard and garden around it. On the pedestal she chiselled 'Sopora', and took her place as a kami (神).
