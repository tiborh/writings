# Being Polite vs Giving Feedback (a first sketch only)

It is often said that you need to act pleasantly surprised when you are given something as a gift. 
However, if you deceive the giver of the gift by pretending you like it, you will often be punished by 
receiving the same unwanted (category of) gift next time too. This problem is usually acute with people who 
do not know you well and/or meet you infrequently. But let's see the two perspectives separately.

## The Receiver

The key points are about how to receive and if you can give confirmation or feedback.

* Can you show gratefulness when you do like or need the gift you received?
  * What about you receiving it from a person you do not like or you suspect to have hidden motives?
  * How happy is appropriate?
  * What are the unspoken gestures of appreciation?
* Why should you receive useless junk?
  * If you need to receive anyway to avoid insult, what do you do with it? (Display? Use? Store? Give away? Throw away?)
* Are you in good enough relationship with the giver so that you may explain if you do not like or want what you are getting?
  * Feedback or respect?

## The Giver

I do not know how other people feel but I always have the fear of being rejected when giving a gift to someone I like or 
respect. It does not mean I get hurt because I do want to find out if my guess was right. It is a little easier with people
you know well. If you are attentive enough you will learn what they are happy about, you catch the occasional hints, 
or they may even tell you what they need from you. (The practical-minded can even maintain an online wishlist you can pick 
from.)

With people you do not know well enough, you can usually fall back on the culturally determined or recommended set gifts 
that fits the person and the occasion. If in doubt, ask a knowledgable elder. They may help you out. Or just Google it. 
Older generations may have outdated ideas what is fitting to the person or occasion especially when the target is much
younger than they are.

The more risk you take in picking something special, the likelier it is to make a miss, but you also have more chance of
being rewarded for your thoughtfullness. Some people do respect if they can recognise the effort or creativity behind 
the gift.

The question of negative feedback: 
* Will it result in correction or insult (or even revenge?)? 
  * You can give it a pragmatic approach: if you are distant relation, you may simply put up with it. 
  * You may even practise Monty Pythonesque absurd humour: putting the nth pullover on top of a stack of the same type 
    from the same giver. 
* Is the giver corrigible? 
  * Is it disrespectful to try? 
  * Can you do it tactfully enough?
