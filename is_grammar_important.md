Is Grammar Important?
=====================

A hard question. And it looks differently from the two sides of the divide:

1. are you a native speaker?
2. are you a language learner?
   1. do you learn English at school?
   2. do you just pick it up?
      1. do you pick it up among native speakers?
      2. do you pick it up during your studies or work?
      
As you can see there is some variation.
