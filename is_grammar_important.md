Is Grammar Important?
=====================

A hard question. And it looks differently from the two sides of the divide:

1. are you a native speaker?
2. are you a language learner?
   1. do you learn English at school?
      1. regular school?
      2. language school?
      3. private tutor?
   2. do you just pick it up?
      1. do you pick it up among native speakers?
      2. do you pick it up during your studies or work?

As you can see there is some variation. And these are the factors that usually determine what your experience is with Grammar. I remember my US colleague after he had borrowed David Crystal's _Rediscover Grammar_ for a weekend and he came back saying: I wish I had something like this with me a few decades earlier. The book helped him understand why something sounds better in one way than in another way. A good summary broadens your perspective, giving the wider context. So lots of native speakers would say: yes, we would need more grammatical knowledge than what we have; we would need to be more conscious users of the language.

At the end of the range is school English in countries where the medieval latin tradition is still strong and therefore grammar is in the very core of the curriculum. In such places you have too much grammar, that is, you are tested on grammar (fill in the gaps, transform the sentences, list the rules, etc.) and vocabulary (dozens of words to learn from one lesson to another, most of which you forget faster than you have learned), often in isolation. Students in this environment usually know quite a lot __about__ the language but cannot communicate __in__ the language. So they will say: we need less grammar and more usage of the language.
