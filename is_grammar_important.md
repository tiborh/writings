Is Grammar Important?
=====================

A hard question. And it looks differently from the two sides of the divide:

1. are you a native speaker?
   1. how much grammar are you taught?
   2. how is grammar taught to you?
2. is English a foreign language to you?
   1. do you learn English at school?
      1. regular school?
      2. language school?
      3. private tutor?
   2. do you just pick it up?
      1. do you pick it up among native speakers?
      2. do you pick it up during your studies or work?

As you can see there is some variation. And these are the factors that usually determine what your experience is with grammar. I remember my colleague from the US after he had borrowed David Crystal's _Rediscover Grammar_ for a weekend and he came back saying: I wish I had something like this a few decades earlier. The book helped him understand why something sounds better in one way than in another. An intelligent summary broadens your perspective, giving the wider context. So lots of native speakers would say: yes, we would need more grammatical knowledge than what we have; we would need to be more conscious users of the language.

At the opposite end of the scale is school English in countries where the medieval Latin tradition is still strong and therefore grammar is in the very core of the curriculum. In such places you tend to have too much grammar, that is, you are drilled and tested on grammar (fill in the gaps, transform the sentences, list the rules, etc.) and vocabulary in isolation (dozens of words to learn from one lesson to another, most of which you forget faster than you have learned). Students in this environment usually know quite a lot __about__ the language but cannot communicate __in__ the language. So they will say: we need less grammar and more usage of the language. They need to be less self-conscious when trying to speak: they should not be blocked by the dread of making (grammatical) mistakes.

But where is the Golden Middle? A little of both worlds: first, you need to know for what purpose you need the language. For spoken communication? For business correspondence? To read books or poems? To understand the lyrics of your favourite songs? To write lyrics? And so on. Once you know what, you can start looking for ways how to achieve that. The quesion will not be more or less grammar but rather: what helps me more on the way. Of course, when one is a child, the parents decide but they also have to ask these questions. It has been pointed out several times that the language skills (in your mother tongue) when you enter elementary school can determine your career as an adult.
