Degrees of Loneliness
=====================

The first may surprise you because it does not seem to do anything with loneliness. However, when one looks back from the next stage, it is easy to see what makes it the first step. Also, at the end I will give the zeroeth step, to show what in my opinion is the ideal state of being.

First: Disequilibrium
---------------------

In the beginning there is the desire and the fear. The desire to be with others and the fear from being alone. At this stage you do not want to be alone and you suffer from being alone. This is a first stage because there is a degree of imbalance which you would like to mend with the company of others. But obviously, you cannot because once you are alone again, you still desire the company of another one.

Second: Clinging
----------------

At this stage you are beginning to be in trouble because others start noticing how desparately you are looking for their company. (As demand rises, prices also grow. Your relationships become more and more expensive and asymmetric.) Most people are scared by this craving. So you find it increasingly difficult to find company or to maintain existing relationships, and as a result, you are more and more disurbed, which chases away all the few who may still linger around. Skillful people can still fight their way back to stage one by making lots of superficial acquaintances on whom they can distribute the full weight of their internal loneliness. The unluckier ones run from one unhappy relationship into another, wasting their and others' time and life.

Third: Burning the Bridges
--------------------------

You are still desparately looking, but you either hurt your prospective friends before they could become your friends, or you take offense at things that others easily gloss over. You are the frustated spinster or the boar. Your social skills are breaking down and it is you only who does not realise that you are becoming antisocial, so you scare away your remaining friends and acquaintances, too.

Fourth: Better Alone
--------------------

At this stage you get some rest. You are beginning to realise that it is better to be on your own than in the company of others. You may use others as tools and may let others do the same to you because you know that this creates a sense of balance: give and take in a business transaction sense. You live alone or you live as if you did so. There can be other people in the same household but you rarely talk more than a few sentences. Or they may try but you soon lose interest.

Fifth: Letting Go
-----------------

A shadow of difficult times. When you are just beginning to enjoy your own world, you have to notice that you have communication problems with others. You cannot keep your attention on people when they talk about something in more than a copule of sentences. You also notice that you often choose not to say what is on your mind, you keep it for yourself. You do not feel the need. Not because you are secretive but because you continue the conversation in yourself. You do not enjoy talking anymore. Sometimes you find pleasure in defeating others with your debating skills, but in the end, you realise that you only do it to let off some steam, so you choose to drop that too.

Sixth: Isolation
----------------

Communication problems exacerbate. Now you find it more and more difficult to put your thoughts into words. In speech you need more time to put together the sentences than the others are prepared to wait patiently, in writing your sentences ring empty and void of your intended meaning after you have spent enormous amount of time creating them. But most of the time you simply cannot get around to write at all. At the same time you notice that you do not care about the mess and dirt that surround you. You do not care what you put on in the morning. If you do not look, you will not even remember the colour of your shoes or shirt (or which one you put on).

Seventh: Nuclear Winter
-----------------------

Only external reports are available about this stage. When one gets this far, you find it difficult to tell if the person is listening to you or not. Understands you or not. Only the simplest and most direct way of communication can get a response: one or two word sentences and when you are facing the person and stand close, or obvious gestures. When this person speaks, you rarely know if it is to you or to himself, or to the people in general.

Zeroeth: Vestibule to Nirvana
-----------------------------

At this stage, which should come first but in reality takes some meandering to arrive at, you are equally happy to be alone or in the company of others. Others usually find your company pleasant because they feel that you listen to them. And you really do. You can forget about yourself when talking to another person. You prefer listening to speaking. You are ready to help others but you rarely initiate interacton. Only when you read in the eyes of the other that they would prefer you to start the conversation. This is the perfect opposite of loneliness and not what most people would think, which is stage one on this scale.
