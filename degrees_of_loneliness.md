Degrees of Loneliness
=====================

The first may surprise you because it does not seem to do anything with loneliness. However, when one looks back from the next stage, it is easy to see what makes it the first step. Also, at the end I will give the zeroeth step, to show what in my opinion is the ideal state of being.

First
-----

In the beginning there is the desire and the fear. The desire to be with others and the fear from being alone. At this stage you do not want to be alone and you suffer from being alone. This is a first stage because there is a degree of imbalance which you would like to mend with the company of others. But obviously, you cannot because once you are alone again, you still desire the company of another one.

Second
------

At this stage you are beginning to be in trouble because others start noticing how desparately you look for their company. Most people are scared by this craving. So you find it more and more difficult to find company, and as a result, you are more and more disurbed, which chases away all the few who may still linger around. Skillful people can still fight their way back to stage one by making lots of acquaintances on whom they can distribute the full weight of their loneliness. The unluckier ones run into one unhappy relationship into another, wasting their and others' time and life.

Third
-----

At this stage, you are still desparately looking, but you either hurt your prospective friends before they could become your friends, or you take offense at things that others easily gloss over. You are the frustated spinster or the boar. Your social skills are breaking down and it is you only who does not realise that you are antisocial.

Fourth
------

At this stage you get some rest. You are beginning to realise that it is better to be on your own than in the company of others. You may use others as tools and may let others do the same to you because you know that this creates a sense of balance: give and take in a business transaction sense. You live alone or you live as if you were alone.

Fifth
-----

A shadow of difficult times. When you are just beginning to enjoy your own world, you have to notice that you have communication problems with others. You cannot keep your attention on people when they talk about something in more than a copule of sentences. You also notice that you rarely say what is on your mind, you keep it for yourself. You do not enjoy conversations any more. Sometimes you enjoy defeating others with your debating skills, but in the end, you realise that you only do it to let off some steam.

Sixth
-----

Communication problems exacerbate. Now you find it more and more difficult to express your thoughts in words. In speech you need more time to put together the sentences than the others are prepared to wait for patiently, in writing your sentences ring empty and void of your intended meaning. At the same time you notice that you do not care about the mess and dirt that surround you. You do not care what you put on in the morning. If you do not look, you may not even remember the colour of your shoes or shirt.

Seventh
-------

Only external reports are available about this stage. When one gets to this stage, you find it difficult to tell if the person is listening to you or not. Understands you or not. Only the simplest and most direct way of communication can get a response: one or two word sentences and when you are facing the person and stand close, or obvious gestures. When this person speaks, you rarely know if it is to you or to himself, or to the people in general.

Zeroeth
-------

At this stage you are equally happy to be alone or in the company of others. Others usually find your company pleasant. They feel that you listen to them. And you really do. You can forget about yourself when talking to another person. You prefer listening to speaking. You are ready to help others but you rarely initiate interacton. Only when you read in the eyes of the other that they would prefer you start the conversation. This is the perfect opposite of loneliness and not what most people would think, which is stage one on this scale.
