The Royal Order
===============

The name, in itself, is an interesting one. I did not meet this expression before this course, even if I studied some linguistics at university. We always had the term without "royal", plain "order of adjectives". And I could not even find a credible explanation on the net either. (Two anecdotal examples: Queen's English has to have a Royal order, order of importance just like in a royal processinon.) 

And then, how do you meet it first? At school. While learning English. Foreign language learners usually dutifully learn it by heart and do the drills not much thinking about it: just another rule to know. By hindsight, it is surprising we did not ask the logical questions: does it exist in our mother tongue too? Is it different from English?
