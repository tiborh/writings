The Royal Order
===============

The name, in itself, is an interesting one. I did not meet this expression before this course, even if I studied some linguistics at university. We always had the term without "royal", plain "order of adjectives". And I could not even find a credible explanation on the net either. (Two anecdotal examples: Queen's English has to have a Royal order, order of importance just like in a royal procession.) 

And then, how do you meet it first? At school. While learning English. Foreign language learners usually dutifully learn it by heart and do the drills not much thinking about it: just another rule to know. By hindsight, it is surprising we did not ask the logical questions: does it exist in our mother tongue too? Is it different from English? I've tried a couple of searches for this effect too, but no luck. Probably, it is left to the linguistic intuition of the users. The reason of course can also be that my native language is not often taught to foreigners. And even those who learn it, have very similar language intuition to ours.

One more attempt: what about translating some examples from English to my mother tongue and check if the natural order is the same. I have used the examples I found [here](http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/adjective_order.htm). All the translations sounded as good in Hungarian as the original phrases in English. And a negative test: mixed up order sounded just as weird. Taking into consideration that Hungarian is not an Indo-European language, not bad.

So, why do we have to learn it? My best guess is that when it comes to and's and commas, it is useful to be able to analyse the adjectives whether they are of the same or different categories. Language awareness helps in editing your writing.
