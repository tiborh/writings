The Guide's Story
-----------------

There was a man who did not know what to do with his life. He went
here and there and in the end he knew his region good enough so he was
able to start guiding travellers and merchants through the land so that
they could find the fastest and safest way or the most scenic routes.

One day he was guiding a doll maker who was making sketches of girls
and women to use them for ideas to create new dolls. The guide helped
him look up several places and showed him where he can make his
portrait sketches without becoming too conspicuous or a target of
suspicion.

The doll maker decided to open up shop in one of the towns. In the same
town also lived an old mage who ordered some dolls to make them into
golems as servants for himself.

The guide became the apprentice of both masters and in a couple of
years he was able to make is own golem. The golem became a fierce,
independent-minded, but faithful servant to her master. She learned
both to wield the sword and to master the sciences. In the eyes of the
mage, the guide was too lenient a master, but it seems the guide
wanted more like a partner than a servant. After she became
knowledgeable enough, they made their decisions together and even
created small girl-golems, who behaved like a mixture of servants,
children, and imps.

After a while, a war broke out between their country and one of the
neighbouring ones. The guide enlisted as a scout and helped defend the
town the armies of various nobles who, under the cover of the war
wanted to take advantage of defenceless settlements. His faithful, but
fierce, golem was always on his side and helped him get out of several
dangerious situations.

By the end of the war, they were among the leaders of the defenders
and also assisted the neighbouring towns with advice and sometimes in
fighting. They became well-known in the region and the robber barons
learnt to stay away from the valleys where they operated.

When the peace arrived the nobles who the town alliance kept in bay
earlier started to conspire against them and seeked to have them
punished in the royal courts as traitors. In the end, they had to go
into exile. The guide managed to find a safe and peaceful place for
his golems and he was also planning to join with them after he had led
their pursuers far away from that spot.

He was trying to evade them far in the north when he found a huge
frozen lake with an island in the middle. The island had a white
castle built on it. When a group of soldiers wanted to cut through the
lake, on the apparently thick ice, they were swallowed up by the lake
after the ice gave way under them.

He new that soon another group may find him with whom he may not be as
lucky as with this one. He was sitting thinking about his options by a
small well-concealed fire when a woman in white appeared next to his
fire and offered her help to make his escape to a different land,
another realm, to which she can open a portal. He happily accepted the
offer and was greatly grateful to her.

He was sad to leave his dear golems behind but he could be certain
that they were safe.
